# odin-recipes
In this project which is part of the course The Odin Project, I will make a recipe website

What I've learned:
- The basics of HTML and GIT
- What a good commit message is
- How to clone a repo, and how to make a new repo
- Basic CSS styling (slight knowledge of flexbox I knew before)
