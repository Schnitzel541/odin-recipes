    <h1>Oven roasted sweet potatoes</h1>
    <h3>The sweetest gift from the ground</h3>
    <p>Sweet potatoes are roasted to perfection with chunky onion wedges and garlic, then finished with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar for a naturally sweet holiday side dish. My Granny made this for Easter dinner. We were all sitting at the table commenting on how delicious it was and asked for the recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sweet Potatoes:</strong><p>This recipe calls for four cups of peeled, chopped sweet potatoes. Depending on the size of your spuds, you'll need four to six sweet potatoes to get four cups.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Onions</strong><p>You'll need one sweet onion (such as Vidalia) cut into wedges to roast along with your sweet potatoes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong><p>Two cloves of thinly sliced fresh garlic give these roasted sweet potatoes an extra burst of flavor.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong><p>Toss the sweet potatoes, onions, and garlic in high-quality olive oil before roasting to prevent sticking and to keep the veggies moist.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Balsemic Vinegar</strong><p>Balsamic vinegar is drizzled over the vegetables after roasting, adding irresistible depth of flavor and subtle acidity.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong><p>Finish these oven-roasted sweet potatoes with salt and ground black pepper.</p></li>
    </ul>
